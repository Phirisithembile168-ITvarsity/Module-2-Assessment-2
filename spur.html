                    <h3>SPUR</h3>
                    <p>Allen Ambor founded Spur Steak Ranches in 1967 when he invested R4 000 to open the Golden Spur in Newlands, Cape Town. He soon opened   the second Spur restaurant in South Africa, Seven Spur in Sea Point.</p>
                    <p> With the immense popularity of these branches, Ambor decided that franchising was the best option to grow the Spur business, while     enabling others to become part of the Spur Family as franchisees.</p>
                    <p> The group first listed on the travel and leisure sector of the JSE in 1986. A major restructuring of the group was undertaken in      1999, which resulted in the formation and listing of Spur Corporation, as we know it today.</p>
                     <p>In November 2004, the group acquired a 60% shareholding in John Dory’s Fish, Grill & Sushi, a KwaZulu-Natal based franchise comprising seven outlets. Founded eight years earlier as a predominantly seafood restaurant, John Dory’s has a distinctly Mediterranean culture and charisma. A further 5% interest was purchased in October 2006, and the remaining 35% was acquired on 25 January 2012, with the group now owning 100% of the business.</p>
                    
                    <p> In December 2013 Spur Corporation bought The Hussar Grill, an upmarket steakhouse chain comprising multiple restaurants in the Western Cape. The franchise, which was started in 1964, is widely regarded as one of the premier grill rooms in Cape Town. The brand has expanded rapidly, with locations in Johannesburg, Durban, Port Elizabeth, as well as Zambia and Saudi Arabia to add to the cornerstone restaurants in the Western Cape.</p>
